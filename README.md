| **ROW 1: TRUST**<br>*(The Foundation)* | **Psychological Safety & LMX**<br>Moving employees from "Out-Group" (transactional) to "In-Group" (high-trust) lowers interpersonal risk perception.<br><br>*Refs: Edmondson (1999); Graen & Uhl-Bien (1995)* | **Secure Attachment Style**<br>The leader acts as a "Secure Base," offering consistent "contingent responsiveness" rather than rigid scheduled meetings.<br><br>*Ref: Bowlby (1988)* | **Amygdala Down-Regulation**<br>High trust inhibits the amygdala (threat detection), allowing the Prefrontal Cortex to function. It reduces the metabolic cost of "scanning for danger."<br><br>*Ref: Cozolino (2006)* |
| **ROW 2: INTEGRITY**<br>*(The Structure)* | **Hygiene Factors & Structural Integrity**<br>Competence is a "Hygiene Factor." Incompetence breaks the "Expectancy Chain," making motivation impossible regardless of vision.<br><br>*Refs: Herzberg (1968); Simons (2002)* | **Psychological Capital ("Guts")**<br>High "PsyCap" (Hope, Efficacy, Resilience, Optimism). The emotional fortitude to be a "shock absorber" for the team.<br><br>*Ref: Luthans et al. (2007)* | **Predictive Coding (Free Energy)**<br>The brain is a "prediction machine." Integrity (alignment of word/deed) minimizes "prediction error," reducing cognitive load.<br><br>*Ref: Friston (2010)* |
| **ROW 3: LEARNING**<br>*(The Growth)* | **Self-Determination Theory (SDT)**<br>Creating "High Clarity" environments that satisfy needs for Autonomy and Competence, leading to "Integrated Regulation."<br><br>*Ref: Ryan & Deci (2000)* | **Self-Expansion & "Graduation"**<br>The drive to expand the self through novel challenges. Overcoming "Bore-out" via the "Alliance" mindset.<br><br>*Ref: Aron & Aron (1986)* | **The "SEEKING" System**<br>Safety + Challenge triggers the release of dopamine and BDNF, physically rewiring the brain for neuroplasticity.<br><br>*Ref: Panksepp (1998)* |
