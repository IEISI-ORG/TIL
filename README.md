| **ROW 1: TRUST**<br>*(The Foundation)* | **Psychological Safety & LMX**<br>Creating an environment where interpersonal risk is safe. Moving employees from "Out-Group" (transactional) to "In-Group" (high-trust).<br><br>*Refs: Edmondson (1999); Graen & Uhl-Bien (1995)* | **Secure Attachment Style**<br>The leader acts as a "Secure Base," offering consistent "contingent responsiveness" rather than rigid scheduled meetings.<br><br>*Refs: Bowlby (1988); Mikulincer & Shaver (2007)* | **Amygdala Down-Regulation**<br>High trust inhibits the amygdala (threat detection), allowing the Prefrontal Cortex (logic/planning) to function. Trust reduces the metabolic cost of "scanning for danger."<br><br>*Refs: Porges (Polyvagal Theory); Cozolino (2006)* |
| **ROW 2: INTEGRITY**<br>*(The Structure)* | **Hygiene Factors & Structural Integrity**<br>Competence is a "Hygiene Factor." Incompetence breaks the "Expectancy Chain" (Effort $\to$ Reward). Integrity is the structural capacity to deliver on promises.<br><br>*Refs: Herzberg (1968); Simons (Behavioral Integrity, 2002)* | **Psychological Capital ("Guts")**<br>High "PsyCap" (Hope, Efficacy, Resilience, Optimism). The emotional fortitude to be a "shock absorber" and maintain stability under pressure.<br><br>*Refs: Luthans et al. (2007); Judge (Emotional Stability)* | **Predictive Coding & Energy Conservation**<br>The brain is a "prediction machine." Integrity (alignment of word/deed) minimizes "prediction error," reducing the cognitive load required for the team to process the leader's behavior.<br><br>*Refs: Friston (Free Energy Principle); Feldman Barrett (2017)* |
| **ROW 3: LEARNING**<br>*(The Growth)* | **Self-Determination Theory (SDT)**<br>Creating "High Clarity" environments that satisfy needs for Autonomy and Competence, leading to "Integrated Regulation" (internalizing the mission).<br><br>*Refs: Ryan & Deci (2000); VSA Model (Karney & Bradbury)* | **Self-Expansion & "Graduation"**<br>The drive to expand the self through novel challenges. Overcoming "Bore-out." The "Alliance" mindset of mutual growth and eventual graduation.<br><br>*Refs: Aron & Aron (1986); Hoffman (The Alliance)* | **Dopaminergic "Seeking" Systems**<br>Safety + Challenge triggers the release of dopamine (motivation/reward) and BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor), physically rewiring the brain for neuroplasticity.<br><br>*Refs: Panksepp (Affective Neuroscience); Dweck (Mindset)* |
